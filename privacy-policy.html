									<h2 data-number="9" id="your_rights">Your Rights</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="t-content ma ma--t_md">
									<p>You
										may contact us (please see par. 11 ‘How to Contact Us’ below) to
										exercise any of the rights you are granted under applicable data
										protection laws, which includes (1) the right to access your data, (2)
										to rectify them, (3) to erase them, (4) to restrict the processing of
										your data, (5) the right to data portability and (6) the right to object
										to processing.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Right to access</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You
										may ask us whether or not we process any of your personal data and, if
										so, receive access to that data in the form of a copy. When complying
										with an access request, we will also provide you with additional
										information, such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of
										personal data concerned as well as any other information necessary for
										you to exercise the essence of this right.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Right to rectification</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You
										have the right to have your data rectified in case of inaccuracy or
										incompleteness. Upon request, we will correct inaccurate personal data
										about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing,
										complete incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a
										supplementary statement.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Right to erasure</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You
										also have the right to have your personal data erased, which means the
										deletion of your data by us and, where possible, by any other controller
										to whom your data has previously been made public by us. Erasure of
										your personal data only finds a place in certain cases, prescribed by
										law and listed under article 17 of the General Data Protection
										Regulation (GDPR). Certain cases include situations where your personal
										data are no longer necessary in relation to the initial purposes for
										which they were processed as well as situations where they were
										processed unlawfully. Due to the way we maintain certain services, it
										may take some time before backup copies are erased.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You
										have the right to obtain the restriction of the processing of your
										personal data, which means that we suspend the processing of your data
										for a certain period of time. Circumstances that may give rise to this
										right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data was
										contested but some time is needed for us to verify their (in)accuracy.
										This right does not prevent us from continue storing your personal data.
										We will inform you before the restriction is lifted.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Your
										right to data portability entails that you may request us to provide
										you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and
										machine-readable format and to have such data transmitted directly to
										another controller, where technically feasible. Upon request and where
										this is technically feasible, we will transmit your personal data
										directly to the other controller.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Right to object</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You
										also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data,
										which means you may request us to no longer process your personal data.
										This only applies in case the ‘legitimate interests’ ground constitutes
										the legal basis for processing (see par. 5 “Legal Basis” above).
									</p>
									<p>At
										any time and free of charge you can object to direct marketing purposes
										in case your personal data are processed for such purposes, which
										includes profiling purposes to the extent that it is related to such
										direct marketing. In case you exercise this right, we will no longer
										process your personal data for such purposes.
									</p>
									<p>You may withdraw
										your consent at any time by following the specific instructions in
										relation to the processing for which you provided your consent, by
										adjusting your settings (if available), or by contacting us (please see
										par. 11 ‘How to Contact Us’).
									</p>

										withdraw your consent for cookies and similar technologies we use when
										you visit our websites, please check our&nbsp;<a

									</p>
									<p>Under
										conditions, we are entitled to deny or restrict your rights as
										described above. In any case, we will carefully assess whether such an
										exemption applies and inform you accordingly.
									</p>
									<p>We may, for
										example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the
										rights and freedoms of other individuals or refuse to delete your
										personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for
										compliance with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for
										example, does not apply in case the personal data was not provided by
										you or if we process the data not on the basis of your consent or for
										the performance of a contract.
									</p>
									<p>When you would like to exercise
										your rights, all you have to do is send your request to us using the
										contact details stated below (please see par. 11 “How to Contact Us”).
									</p>
									<p>You
										can also contact us if you have any questions, remarks, or complaints
										in relation to this privacy policy. However, if you have unresolved
										concerns, you also have the right to complain to the Dutch Data
										Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, dutchdpa.nl) located
										in Hague, the Netherlands.
